# 2 Ship 2 Harkinian Switch

[![generate-builds](https://github.com/YoshiCrystal9/2ship2harkinian-Switch/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YoshiCrystal9/2ship2harkinian-Switch/actions/workflows/main.yml)

I did not make this, all cred gos to YoshiCrystal9 and his repo [here](https://github.com/YoshiCrystal9/2ship2harkinian-Switch)

A rebuild and release of the code base that fixes crashes at Ikana Canyon.

I did not modify the code, just wanted a place others that have the issue can go download without having to compile while waiting for the new official release from YoshiCrystal9 with this fix.

### How to use

1. download Windows build from here https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian/actions/runs/13642391583
2. extract zip
3. put your mm rom \*.z64 file in folder
4. start 2ship.exe
5. when done, you have 2ship.o2r and mm.o2r files, keep them
6. download switch files here https://github.com/tloftis/2ship2harkinian-switch-Ikana-canyon-fix/releases/tag/1.1.3
7. extract zip
8. put your previous .o2r files in folder
9. put folder on your Switch's "switch" folder

(thx Jero for the instructions)
